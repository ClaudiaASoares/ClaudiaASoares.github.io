I am a researcher at [NOVA LINCS](https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/) and an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/en) of the [NOVA School of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en). I do scientific consulting to [Neuraspace](https://www.neuraspace.com/), to fight Space Debris with Machine Learning. My work is broadly on trustworthy ML for critical Systems, like healthcare, and physical systems (swarms of artificial agents, underwater unmanned vehicles, and satellites). 

My Erd√∂s number is 4.
