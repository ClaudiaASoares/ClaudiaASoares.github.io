Thank you for your interest in our Trustworthy ML @ NOVA group!

Trustworthy ML is a group hosted by NOVA that focuses on advancing machine learning for the real world. Our mission is to develop ML algorithms that consider *ethical, safety,* and *social* implications and provide a space for exchanging ideas between researchers, practitioners, and industry. We recognize the power of ML to create a better world but also understand its potential for dangerous mistakes, misuse, and abuse.

We produce developments in the research area, such as physics-guided learning, robust ML, large-scale learning, interpretability, privacy, fairness, accountability, transparency, and more.
