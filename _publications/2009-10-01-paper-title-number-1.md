excerpt: 'Emergency Department overcrowding is driven, in
part, by non-urgent patients that resort
to emergency services despite not having a medical emergency, representing
almost half of the total number of daily
patients. This paper describes a novel
deep learning architecture, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, that uses calendar and time-series covariates to forecast prediction intervals and point predictions for a 4-week period. We have
concluded that patient volume can be
forecast with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.87%.'

Emergency Departments (EDs) are a
fundamental element of the Portuguese
National Health Service, serving as an
entry point for users with diverse and
very serious medical problems. Due to
the inherent characteristics of the ED,
forecasting the number of patients using the services is particularly challenging. And a mismatch between affluence and the number of medical professionals can lead to a decrease in the
quality of the services provided and create problems that have repercussions
for the entire hospital, with the requisition of healthcare workers from other
departments and the postponement of
surgeries. ED overcrowding is driven, in
part, by non-urgent patients that resort
to emergency services despite not having a medical emergency, representing
almost half of the total number of daily
patients. This paper describes a novel
deep learning architecture, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, that uses calendar and time-series covariates to forecast prediction intervals and point predictions for a 4-week period. We have
concluded that patient volume can be
forecast with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.87% for Portugal’s Health Regional Areas (HRA) and
a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 178 people/day. The paper shows empirical evidence supporting the use of a
multivariate approach with static and
time-series covariates while surpassing
other models commonly found in the literature.
