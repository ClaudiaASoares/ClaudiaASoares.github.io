permalink: /publication/2023-Probabilistic-registration
excerpt: 'We propose a method for fitting/registering shapes with missing data using Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes provide a powerful tool for shape modelling and fitting. However, existing methods in this area do not work well for detailed and deformed data with extensive missing data, such as ears. To address this, we use a multi-annotator Gaussian process regression to formulate the shape fitting problem and establish a parallel with standard probabilistic registration. Our method, called the shape fitting Gaussian process (SFGP), outperforms current approaches for registration with GP and a state-of-the-art registration method when dealing with extensive missing data. We conducted experiments on both a small 2D dataset with several transformations and a 3D dataset of ears.'
