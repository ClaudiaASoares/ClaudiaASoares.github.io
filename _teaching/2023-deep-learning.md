Just a few years ago, there was no abundance of deep tech companies, large and small, where deep learning specialists
(mostly with PhDs) develop incredible, practical systems that are widely used. These systems cover a variety of 
research areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning — topics 
that we'll cover in this course. The success of deep learning has even inspired research in theoretical 
learning theory and mathematics. These tools are already having a major influence on industry and society, 
revolutionizing how films are made, machines are designed, and playing a larger role in fundamental sciences — from 
astrophysics to medicine.
