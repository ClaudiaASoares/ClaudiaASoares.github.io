abstract="Emergency Departments (EDs) are a fundamental element of the Portuguese National Health Service, serving as an entry point for users with diverse and very serious medical problems. Due to the inherent characteristics of the ED, forecasting the number of patients using the services is particularly challenging. And a mismatch between the affluence and the number of medical professionals can lead to a decrease in the quality of the services provided and create problems that have repercussions for the entire hospital, with the requisition of health care workers from other departments and the postponement of surgeries. ED overcrowding is driven, in part, by non-urgent patients, that resort to emergency services despite not having a medical emergency and which represent almost half of the total number of daily patients. This paper describes a novel deep learning architecture, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, that uses calendar and time-series covariates to forecast prediction intervals and point predictions for a 4 week period. We have concluded that patient volume can be forecasted with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.91{\%} for Portugal's Health Regional Areas (HRA) and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 84.4102 people/day. The paper shows empirical evidence supporting the use of a multivariate approach with static and time-series covariates while surpassing other models commonly found in the literature.",

                  positions of multiple underwater vehicles based on a
                  set of pairwise range and bearing measurements taken
                  over time. This extends prior work on the so-called
                  (static) collaborative localization paradigm where a
                  hybrid approach was proposed for seamless
                  instantaneous fusion (i.e., no time dependence) of
                  range and bearing measurements. To incorporate time
                  we add to the original convexified least-squares
                  cost function a regularizing term that penalizes
                  deviations between predicted and computed vehicle
                  positions at a given instant. The method operates
                  progressively over time, with past estimates used
                  for prediction at the current instant assuming a
                  very simple quasilinear motion model. The method is
                  amenable to parallelization, with simple
                  gradient-like updates. Numerical results demonstrate
                  promising accuracy gains (reduction on the order of
                  10 \% in terms of root-mean-square positioning error)

abstract = "We propose hybrid methods for localization in wireless sensor networks fusing noisy range measurements with angular information (extracted from video). Compared with conventional methods that rely on a single sensed variable, this may pave the way for improved localization accuracy and robustness. We address both the single-source and network (i.e., cooperative multiple-source) localization paradigms, solving them via optimization of a convex surrogate. The formulations for hybrid localization are unified in the sense that we propose a single nonlinear least-squares cost function, fusing both angular and range measurements. We then relax the problem to obtain an estimate of the optimal positions. This contrasts with other hybrid approaches that alternate the execution of localization algorithms for each type of measurement separately, to progressively refine the position estimates. Single-source localization uses a semidefinite relaxation to obtain a one-shot matrix solution from which the source position is derived through factorization. Network localization uses a different approach where sensor coordinates are retained as optimization variables, and the relaxed cost function is efficiently minimized using fast iterations based on Nesterov’s optimal method. Further, an automated calibration procedure is developed to express range and angular information, obtained through different devices, possibly deployed at different locations, in a single consistent coordinate system. This drastically reduces the need for manual calibration that would otherwise negatively impact the practical usability of hybrid range/video localization systems. We develop and test, both in simulation and experimentally, the new hybrid localization algorithms, which not only overcome the limitations of previous fusing approaches, but also compare favourably to state-of-the-art methods, even outperforming them in some scenarios.",

abstract = {Morgan Stanley forecasts the space industry to top 1 trillion dollars by 2040. Of these 1 trillion dollars, 1.5 billion dollars are expected to be the contribution of the space situational market alone. Satellite operators are already paying the price of space debris. Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face serious challenges, mainly: (1) Insufficient data and endangered autonomy of action in space; (2) A high number of false alerts and a large uncertainty; (3) Lack of scalability and automation for an increasing number of assets. This paper explores the potential of AI for Space and presents some of the advances made by Neuraspace in Space Traffic Management, including the analysis of conjunction data messages (CDMs), predicting uncertainties, and risk classification, and the economic benefits of new approaches. Further, the paper addresses the need for a more active role of the private sector and an evolution of the role of the public sector to foster space sustainability and support the growth companies leading this effort.}

abstract = {Real-world network applications must cope with failing nodes, malicious attacks, or nodes facing corrupted data — data classified as outliers. Our work addresses these concerns in the scope of the sensor network localization problem where, despite the abundance of technical literature, prior research seldom considered outlier data. We propose robust, fast, and distributed network localization algorithms, resilient to high-power noise, but also precise under regular Gaussian noise. We use a Huber M-estimator, thus obtaining a robust (but nonconvex) optimization problem. We convexify and change the problem representation, to allow for distributed robust localization algorithms: a synchronous distributed method that has optimal convergence rate and an asynchronous one with proven convergence guarantees. A major highlight of our contribution lies on the fact that we pay no price for provable distributed computation neither in accuracy, nor in communication cost or convergence speed. Simulations showcase the superior performance of our algorithms, both in the presence of outliers and under regular Gaussian noise: our method exceeds the accuracy of alternative approaches, distributed and centralized, even under heavy additive and multiplicative outlier noise.}
